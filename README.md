# CS260 - Data Structures

This course explores the correct use of a variety of data structures in Java program. Include the topics of complexity analysis, simple and complex sorting algorithms, stacks, queues, priority queues, arrays, linked-lists, file processing, tree structures, binary search trees, hashing algorithms and recursion.

## Assignment 1

Make a list of properties and behaviors for a bag of marbles, implement them, test the implementation in a driver class (open-ended, I know, but go with it), and demonstrate program correctness.

## Assignment 2

Design, implement and demonstrate an ArrayStack or a LinkedStack class. Analyze the real complexity of your implementations, and compare them to our design ayalysis. **Bonus**: if you also do a queue!

## Assignment 3

Create an array or linked list that allows adding and removing from any position.

## Assignment 4

Create a list that automatically inserts values in the correct position, efficiently searches for elements, and compares a recursive and a non-recursive solution.

## Assignment 5

Implement a basic binary tree and analyze your structure's behaviors.

## Assignment 6

Implement a BST and compare the complexity of insert and search to a basic binary tree.

## Assignment 7

Create an overwriting hashtable and a smarter hashtable and compare collisions and complexity (of insert and contains methods).

## Assignment 8

Implement mergesort, quicksort, and heapsort as a methd availble for an unsorted list.
